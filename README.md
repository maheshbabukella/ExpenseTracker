# Mahesh Babu's Expense Tracker
This is a responsive and user-friendly Expense Tracker developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to efficiently manage their personal finances by tracking income and expenses in real-time.

Built as part of my Full Stack Developer learning journey, this project showcases my front-end skills and my understanding of DOM manipulation, state updates, and clean UI design.
